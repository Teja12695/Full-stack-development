CSS means cascading styling sheeets.
It gives styling to the HTML


Syntax --->      selector{
                        property1:value1;
                        property2:value2;
                 }


We can write CSS code --->  1.In the HTML file / In the same html file
                            2.Outside the HTML file / in the other external file
                            3.Within the Elements / inline 




1.In the HTML file / In the same html file :



                            In HTML FILE --- in  head element we have to write it.

                            <head>

                                <style>
                                    selector{
                                            property1:value1;
                                            property2:value2;
                                    }
                                </style>
                            </head>


2.Outside the HTML file / in the other external file :

---->  First we need to creat a external file with css extension (for example ---> myproject.css)
---->  We need to link that css file(for example--> myproject.css) to HTML file by using link tag in head element
---->  <head>
            <link rel="styelsheet" href = "myproject.css">
       </head>
---->  Only after linking the CSS.file styling will be applied to the HTML file
---->  With the help of selector names styling will be applied to the required elements by using (class,id,etc..)   attributes.


3.Within the Elements / inline :

---> Very simple one we can diretly apply the styling in the required element directly
---> for example ----- 
                <h1 style = "color:blue;"> content </h1> 
    (content means whatever we write thats all)
