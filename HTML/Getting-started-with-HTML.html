    HTML means Hyper Text Markup Language

    only with the help of HTML we can create websites

    HTML is a Forgiving language

    HTML is not case-senitive

    Our Browser renders(loads) the HTMl code of any website

    BASIC STRUCTURE OF HTML

<!DOCTYPE html>    --- (version of html)
<html lang="en">   --- (language)
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>             --- (the content for website should be written in it)
    
</body>
</html>
-->


<!--
    Elements

    Element is everything from start tag to end tag
    EXAMPLE---) <h1>hello world</h1>

    here <h1> is starting tag
         </h1> is ending tag
         (hello world) is content

-->

<h1>HELLO WORLD</h1>


<!--
    PATH

    PATH -- is nothing but location of the data
    there are two types of paths 1.Relative path
                                 2.Absolute path

    We mainly used relative path 

    absolute path ---means the perfect location of data from the root

    relative path ---means the location in same folder


    the paths used in HTML are

    1.Images
    2.Style Sheets
    3.JS file
    4.Extenal links
    5.Links to another Html of the same project
